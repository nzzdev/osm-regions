## Data

The following data is provided:

- [Land borders of countries](https://github.com/nzzdev/osm-regions/releases/download/v0.1.0/countries-v0.1.0.zip) (as defined in [ISO_3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)) extracted from OpenStreetMap as GeoJSON
- [Land borders of subdivisions](https://github.com/nzzdev/osm-regions/releases/download/v0.1.0/subdivisions-v0.1.0.zip) (as defined in [ISO_3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2)) extracted from OpenStreetMap as GeoJSON
- [Vector tile set in mbtiles format](https://github.com/nzzdev/osm-regions/releases/download/v0.1.0/regions-v0.1.0.zip) with 2 layers (countries, subdivisions) for simplified rendering of the data, compatible with OpenMapTiles

### Rebuilding the data

Have a look at [the steps required to extract and prepare the data](STEPS.md)

### Preparing a new release

Run this script to generate release assets in `prepare-release/release-assets`:

`{version}` should be the version tag, e.g. v0.2.0

```bash
prepare-release/prepare-release.sh {version}
```

## Uses

This data is used in the [Q Locator Map Tool](https://github.com/nzzdev/Q-locator-map),
for which a [demo](https://editor.q.tools) is also available.
